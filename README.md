# AnagramDetector
Inspired by an interview question :D

Given a list of words as input, group the anagrams together and output a list of lists

An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.

e.g.

Input: ["cat", "bag", "act", "tac", "top", "pot"]

Output: [ ["cat", "act", "tac"], ["bag"], ["top", "pot"] ]
